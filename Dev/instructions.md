When I look at my Covid_GeoTracker web App, I'm able to imput my location data,

    then I see, a responsive webpage,
    Then I get an option to imput my desire date, zipcode/city name or state.

When I imput my zipcode/city name, state

    Then I get a full simplified briefing.

    The briefing should include the hotspot location, weather, temperature of that city, population, and weather forecast.
