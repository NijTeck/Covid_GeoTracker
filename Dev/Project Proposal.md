Proposal _________ 


****** STARTS  ******** 

<title> Covid_GeoTracker </title>

<p> 

This web app will determine hotspot for covid impactation based on given location, and  also provide
location on a travel route along with population density, using both the weather API and the Geo_location API. 
This project will include as simply two page HTML, along with advanced CSS stylyings. 

</p> 


<h1> 
user wants to find safe route between <point> a and <point> b 
and use the Covid_GeoTraker web App to find safest travel route.


When I look at my Covid_GeoTracker web App, I'm able to imput my location data, 
* then I see, a responsive webpage, 
* Then I get an option to imput my desire date, zipcode/city name or state.

When I imput my zipcode/city name, state 
* Then I get a full simplified briefing.
* The briefing should include the hotspot location,  weather, temperature of that city, 
  population, and weather forecast.
  
                   ( Doing DATA comparism  to past historical DATA )  
      ( WE could also do a redirect to data source for more advance data analysis)
