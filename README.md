*COVID-19 data Overview
https://rapidapi.com/Gramzivi/api/covid-19-data




We collect information from several reliable sources, like Johns Hopkins CSSE, CDC, WHO and a few others. All our sources are verified, and we avoid collecting information that is not confirmed by official authorities.

Every country sends official reports differently. From once per day to every hour. That depends on the scale of the pandemic and the time zone. Nevertheless, we are trying to update every new information ASAP.

If you have a specific wish, please let us know (Discussions), and we will try to put it on our road map. This is a non-profit humanitarian project, and all the money we get goes for better servers, data providers and other expenses for providing you with a better, faster and more reliable API. Stay safe.


*Telize API Documentation

Telize offers a JSON IP and GeoIP REST API allowing to get a visitor IP address and to query location information from any IP address. It outputs JSON-encoded IP geolocation data, and supports both Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) and JSONP.

## Usage 

user wants to find safe route between a and b and use the Covid_GeoTraker web App to find safest travel route.

When I look at my Covid_GeoTracker web App, I'm able to imput my location data,

    then I see, a responsive webpage,
    Then I get an option to imput my desire date, zipcode/city name or state.

When I imput my zipcode/city name, state

    Then I get a full simplified briefing.

    The briefing should include the hotspot location, weather, temperature of that city, population, and weather forecast.
