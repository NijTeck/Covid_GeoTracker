## TECHNOLOGIES

*(   https://get.foundation/  


   ** COVID-19 data Overview
url : "https://api.covid19api.com/summary",




We collect information from several reliable sources, like Johns Hopkins CSSE, CDC, WHO and a few others. All our sources are verified, and we avoid collecting information that is not confirmed by official authorities.

Every country sends official reports differently. From once per day to every hour. That depends on the scale of the pandemic and the time zone. Nevertheless, we are trying to update every new information ASAP.

If you have a specific wish, please let us know (Discussions), and we will try to put it on our road map. This is a non-profit humanitarian project, and all the money we get goes for better servers, data providers and other expenses for providing you with a better, faster and more reliable API. Stay safe.


 **  Telize API Documentation

Telize offers a JSON IP and GeoIP REST API allowing to get a visitor IP address and to query location information from any IP address. It outputs JSON-encoded IP geolocation data, and supports both Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) and JSONP.
